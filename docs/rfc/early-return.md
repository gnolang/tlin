# RFC: Early Return Opportunities

## Summary

This lint rule detects if-else chains that can be simplified using early returns. It aims to improve code readability by flattening unnecessary nested structures.

## Motivation

Deeply nested if-else chains can make code harder to read and maintain. By identifying opportunities for early returns, we can simplify the code structure, making it more linear and easier to follow. This not only improves readability but can also reduce the cognitive load on developers working with the code.

## Proposed Implementation

The implementation consists of a main function `DetectEarlyReturnOpportunities` and several helper functions. The core logic includes:

1. Analyzing if-else chains in the AST.
2. Identifying opportunities for early returns.
3. Generating suggestions for code improvement.
4. Providing detailed issue reports.

### Rule Details

- **Rule ID**: early-return
- **Severity**: warning
- **Category**: code style
- **Auto-fixable**: Yes[^1]
- **Description**: Detects if-else chains that can be simplified using early returns.

### Key Components

1. `analyzeIfElseChain`: Builds a representation of the if-else chain.
2. `canUseEarlyReturn`: Determines if an early return can be applied.
3. `RemoveUnnecessaryElse`: Generates an improved version of the code.
4. `extractSnippet`: Extracts the relevant code snippet for analysis.
5. `generateEarlyReturnSuggestion`: Creates a suggestion for code improvement.

### Code Examples

#### Before:

```go
if condition1 {
    // some code
    return result1
} else {
    if condition2 {
        // some more code
        return result2
    } else {
        // final code
        return result3
    }
}
```

#### After:

```go
if condition1 {
    // some code
    return result1
}
if condition2 {
    // some more code
    return result2
}
// final code
return result3
```

## Alternatives

1. Manual refactoring: Relying on developers to identify and refactor these patterns manually.

## Implementation Impact

- Positive: Improved code readability and maintainability.
- Negative: May require significant changes to existing codebases if widely applied.

## Open Questions

1. Should we consider the complexity of the conditions when suggesting early returns?
2. How should we handle cases where the else block contains multiple statements?
3. Should we provide a configuration option to set a maximum nesting level for applying this rule?
4. How do we ensure that the meaning of the code is preserved when applying early returns, especially in the presence of defer statements or other Go-specific constructs?
