## Introduction

tlin is an linter designed for both [Go](https://go.dev/) and [gno](https://gno.land/) programming languages. It leverages the functionality of [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) as its main linting engine, providing powerful code analysis for go-like grammar languages.

Inspired by Rust's [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy), tlin aims to provide additional code improvement suggestions beyond the default golangci-lint rules.

## Features

- Support for Go (.go) and Gno (.gno) files
- Ability to add custom lint rules
- Additional code improvement suggestion, such as detecting unnecessary code (ðŸš§ WIP)

## Installation

- Requirements:
    - Go: 1.22 or higher
    - latest version of gno

To install tlin CLI, run:

```bash
go install ./cmd/tlin
```

## Usage

```bash
tlin <path>
```

Replace `<path>` with the file or directory path you want to analyze.

To check the current directory, run:

```bash
tlin .
```

## Adding Custom Lint Rules

tlin allows addition of custom lint rules beyond the default golangci-lint rules. To add a new lint rule, follow these steps:

1. Add a function defining the new rule in the `internal/rule_set.go` file.

Example:

```go
func (e *Engine) detectNewRule(filename string) ([]Issue, error) {
    // rule implementation
}
```

2. Add the new rule to the `Run` method in the `internal/lint.go` file.

```go
newRuleIssues, err := e.detectNewRule(tempFile)
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("error detecting new rule: %w", err)
}
filtered = append(filtered, newRuleIssues...)
```

3. If necessary, define an output format for the new rule in `internal/print.go`.
