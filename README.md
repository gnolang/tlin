## Introduction

tlin is an linter designed for both [Go](https://go.dev/) and [gno](https://gno.land/) programming languages. It leverages the functionality of [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) as its main linting engine, providing powerful code analysis for go-like grammar languages.

Inspired by Rust's [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy), tlin aims to provide additional code improvement suggestions beyond the default golangci-lint rules.

## Features

- Support for Go (.go) and Gno (.gno) files
- Ability to add custom lint rules
- Additional code improvement suggestion, such as detecting unnecessary code (üöß WIP)

## Installation

- Requirements:
  - Go: 1.22 or higher
  - latest version of gno

To install tlin CLI, run:

```bash
go install ./cmd/tlin
```

## Usage

```bash
tlin <path>
```

Replace `<path>` with the file or directory path you want to analyze.

To check the current directory, run:

```bash
tlin .
```

## Adding Custom Lint Rules

tlin allows addition of custom lint rules beyond the default golangci-lint rules. To add a new lint rule, follow these steps:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Must update relevant tests if you have added a new rule or formatter.

1. Implement the `LintRule` interface for your new rule:

```go
type NewRule struct{}

func (r *NewRule) Check(filename string) ([]Issue, error) {
    // Implement your lint rule logic here
    // return a slice of Issues and any error encountered
}
```

2. Register your new rule in the `registerDefaultRules` method of the `Engine` struct in `internal/engine.go`:

```go
func (e *Engine) registerDefaultRules() {
    e.rules = append(e.rules,
        &GolangciLintRule{},
        // ...
        &NewRule{}, // Add your new rule here
    )
}
```

3. (Optional) if your rule requires special formatting, create a new formatter in the `formatter` package:

   a. Create a new file (e.g., `formatter/new_rule.go`).
   b. Implement the `IssueFormatter` interface for your new rule:

   ```go
   type NewRuleFormatter struct{}

   func (f *NewRuleFormatter) Format(
       issue lints.Issue,
       snippet *internal.SourceCode,
   ) string {
       // Implement formatting logic for new rule here.
   }
   ```

   c. Add the new formatter to the `GetFormatter` function in `formatter/fmt.go`.

   ```go
   func GetFormatter(rule string) IssueFormatter {
       switch rule {
       // ...
       case "new_rule": // Add your new rule here
           return &NewRuleFormatter{}
       default:
           return &DefaultFormatter{}
       }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can add new lint rules and ensure they are properly formatted when displayed in the CLI.
